# How to pull this project
1. create an empty folder in your local pc
2. git pull main branch to your local pc
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jimmysoccer/The-Adventure-of-Dial.git
git pull origin main
```
# How to modify and push it to github
1. modify your local changes
2. git pull from the main branch before push anything to github just in case of the potential conflicts
3. <b>only</b> add <b>Assets</b> directory because other things like Library/ or temp/ are auto generated by Unity and it doesn't affect the functionality of the project
```
git pull origin main
git add Assets/
git commit -m 'your message'
git push origin main
```
